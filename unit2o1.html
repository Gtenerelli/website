            page </b></h3>
            <div class="unit2">
                I decided to go for a simple layout ,trying to be readable and accessible to use , a clear navigation bar that stays across the whole website for each page.
                I made the <b>Home/About me</b> as a simple page containing a short history about my self, the rest of the pages contains the questions and answers relevant to this part of the course.

        <h3><b>Describing copyright and other constraints
            affecting websites</b></h3>
            <div class="unit2">
                Each website should be aware of the source of all its materials and contents and should have the appropriate permissions or licence to use it. Failure to ensure you have the permission or ownership of the content can lead to potentially costly legal issues, costs associated with redesigning the website or ultimately the website being taken down.
                Let's say...If you wrote an original song, or a piece of artwork , all you need to do is put your signature on there and a © to prevent people potentially selling, distributing, performing or placing the work on the internet.
                So the difference between the permission is for non-commercial research, private study or to use in something that won't make any financial gains ... but anyway you may not get it to use someone's work for different reasons.

            <h3><b>Access issues that need taking into account - how will people with a disability access the webiste? </b></h3>
            <div class="unit2">
                Visual or audio elements make a website clearer considering people who may respond to visual or audible.
                People with visual impairment may need to use a screen reader to access a sites content, in this case we should ensure all images have descriptor tags and videos have subtitles and or audio description functions.

            <h3><b>Describe which are the appropriate filetypes
                for websites</b></h3>
                <div class="unit2">
                What makes a website really attractive is the use of files arranged in an interesting layout for users to interact with....but common files are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Audio – .wav .mp3 .aac .mid .midi</li>

                    <li>Video – .webm .flv .mov .qt . avi .rm .wmv .mpg .mpeg .mp4</li>
                    
                    <li>Images – .jpg .jpeg .tif .tiff .gif .png .svg</li>
                </ul>
                Each file type has its advantages and disadvantages and it is dependant on the website creator to select the format which is best for the task.</div>
