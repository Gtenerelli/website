                IT tools can have many benefits in terms of productivity and efficiency....not only Trello helped me keeping up the time working and organization but tools like Slack allow team a greater communciation and to focus on the creation of contents. 
                About my own project i could have done a better job spending less time if i firstly planned the various elements to stylize in <b>CSS</b> and maybe i could get a better vision of the website in terms of graphic.

            <h3><b>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</b></h3>
            <div class="uno1o3">Using AI tools, testers can increase test effectiveness, as the tool can identify the areas of code where tests are likely to fail and focus testing on those areas. Getting other team members to test the final product and also testing iterations of parts of the project may also been beneficial to see how they go about interacting with the site and looking for any potential issues end users might encounter. Testing with external users may also be beneficial as they may interact with the project in a different way to technical members of the team.
