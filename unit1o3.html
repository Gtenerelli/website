            done it in teams? </b></h3>
            <div class="uno1o3"> 
                IT tools can have many benefits in terms of productivity and efficiency....not only Trello helped me keeping up the time working and organization but tools like Slack allow team a greater communciation and to focus on the creation of contents. 
                About my own project i could have done a better job spending less time if i firstly planned the various elements to stylize in <b>CSS</b> and maybe i could get a better vision of the website in terms of graphic.

            <div class=uno1o3>
                Using your most productive times of the day for the most important activities and be concentrate on the project.
                Being efficient,considering how my business is currently operating, and open to try new methods of work...trying reducing distractions and costs.
                Another practice that can be really useful is practice using the right Tools and Equipment...afterall i think that as I become a more experienced developer, I will find more uniform ways of working with code but till today i recognize that the use of keyboard short cuts, recording a macro to automate a process or getting a web browser to save often used details like name and address can help to improve productivity ...or things such a typing tutor to improve keyboard efficiency.

                What would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</b></h3>
                <div class="uno1o3">

                    I will think about my to-do-list and fist i'll prioritize my important tasks....being more organized i'll may get the chance to boost my productivity.
                    If I had to work on a website in a team in future i'll definetly use Slack to keepsharing my workload with my team and to compare codes with each other, I would make sure that we’re all on Slack together, with a team channel and a Trello board with labels for each team member to view who is working on which tasks just to be more organized and can boost productivity too. 
                    Using Slack also to fellow team mates to help troubleshoot issues and get suggestions on how to solve problems as they arise and learning each other effective techniques, working methods and favourite shorcuts...A recent one that i really like ,suggested from a team mate is Shift-F7 and is used to show design view of your webpage.

            <h3><b>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</b></h3>
            <div class="uno1o3">Using AI tools, testers can increase test effectiveness, as the tool can identify the areas of code where tests are likely to fail and focus testing on those areas. Getting other team members to test the final product and also testing iterations of parts of the project may also been beneficial to see how they go about interacting with the site and looking for any potential issues end users might encounter. Testing with external users may also be beneficial as they may interact with the project in a different way to technical members of the team.
