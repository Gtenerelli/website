            <p class="about">
                I've been interested in <b>computer science</b> since i was kid,then with time i got less confidence with it and get more interested in design so i decided to study through a graphic design school where i get a qualification as graphic operator. 
                <br>After this i did choose to move in London starting a new work experience and improve my study or either enter on the technology industry once i'm going to be comfortable with my English.
                <br>
                Firstly when i came in London about 2016 i started working in the hospitality sector which then i liked but since the pandemic took over with the new restictions and other things let's say that the sector isn't refilled as before.
                <br>
                During this free time i wanted to improve my graphic design skills / knowledge or something involved in the IT industry and i get the opportunity to learn how to code with <b>CodeNation</b>, learning HTML, CSS and Python.
                i'm really happy and i find this really interesting even because will be nice to learn  different programming languages (might i'll go more on deep with them) so maybe on the future i'll get the chance to assimilate anylanguage i want to my graphic design skills to make any project at the best of it.
