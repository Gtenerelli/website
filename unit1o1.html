        <h3><b>Methods, skills and resources needed to complete a digital projects: </b></h3> 
        <div class ="uno1o1">Few of the fundamentalds to complete any digital project are <b>organization</b>, <b>communication</b> and <b>planning</b> which is key to a successful project.
        <br>At the start of the project a clear list of requirements should be laid out, the team should then be reviewed to ensure the correct skillset is present and if not additional people or learning may have to be taken on board.Once those steps are completed the task should be broken up and parts assigned to individual team members based on their skillset.

          <br> 
          <br>
          After an in-depth analysis of what is mainly useful to us while we decide to start a digital project, subsequently we go on specific with other useful and most requested knowledge:
            <ul>
                <li>Copywriting & Editing</li>
                <li>HTML,CSS</li>
                <li>Problem-solving</li>
                <li>Attention to detail</li>
                <li>Research skills</li>
                <li>Time management</li>
            </ul>  
            Afterall even social media or app can be useful to undestand better how technology is evolving.. and we could always take a cue from those sources.

        <h3><b>Plan and carry out tasks using IT</b></h3>
        <div class ="uno1o1">I will mainly use Trello to plan the development of the website. I will do this by breaking the project down into specific tasks and using  the three columns to track the status. These columns "To Do", "Doing" and "Done", as each task progresses it will pass between each of these columns until all tasks are under "Done". So having a working methodology such as Trello and the use of different software to create various flowchart will help greatly.

            <br>
            The main tool i will use to create the site will be Visual Studio Code and surely Google as main research methods....not to be missed others software may needed to edit and create images Ex. Adobe Photoshop Elements,InDesign,and <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000760.htm" target="_blank"> many more</a>....
            <!--then i'll might be able to edit and create images with software like Adobe photoshop Elements-->

        <p><h3><b>Risk to consider that might impact a digital project: </b> </h3>
            
            <div class ="uno1o1"> Few factor that could affect my digital project can be things like intermittent access to the internet as my first project/work i can say was depending on it as i had to make a bit of research but also get in touch my team ...but even a laptop failure which can be really struggle especially if the work been incidentally unsaved.

                Other risks to consider are:
                <li>Poor Estimation Practices</li>
                <li>Communication gaps</li>>
                <li>Poor project management</li>
                <li>Time keeping on tasks</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <br>
        <h3><b>Selecting IT systems and software: </b> </h3>
            
        <div class ="uno1o1">Try always to be update with them and get a future proof considering what my needs are today but also what they might be in the future ...as the technology moves fast it's worth keeping up with the new developments. After all software and systems should be also selected on the basis of what will fit the client needs too.
            <br>
            Once i get my requirements usually consider a second opinion from a trusted friend or web sources.

        <h3><b>Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.
            How has Trello helped you plan and how can Git and GitHub help with your codes version control</b> </h3>
            <div class ="uno1o1">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Trello:</b>
                The first time I used Trello was for the first group digital project started where the goal was to create a simple digital game ... Trello allows you to organize and prioritize projects in a fun, flexible and rewarding way. I found this really comfortable... the board is a series of lists,  and filled with powerful features and automation.</li><br>
            </li>
            <li><b>GitHub:</b>
                Regarding Git-Hub I have not yet gone into depth but basically I would describe it as if it were a social network for developers that can mainly be used by the terminal and from there it allows us to save small development steps of our project, it is also very useful because allows you to go back in the history of our code, modify the error and republish while maintaining an active collaboration with other developers.
                Github also allows us to showcase our skills ... and this can be really helpful as any other collaborator on the project can clear up any doubts with each other.</li>

        <h3><b>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects
            How does GDPR impact digital projects?</b></h3>
            <br>
            <div class ="uno1o1">All software should be written to comply is local and global laws and guidelines, this often means writing code to defend confidential or sensitive information such as names, addresses, credit card or bank account information. Information should also not be kept longer than it is required, and code should be designed to reflect this requirement.
        <br>
            GDPR is a regulation that requires businesses to protect the personal data and privacy of EU citizens for transactions that occur within EU member states. And non-compliance could cost companies dearly.
            f these guidelines are not followed and there is a data breach, then potentially confidential information could fall into the wrong hands causing issues for customers and the company. Such leaks are often featured in the news, examples include the leak for 150,000 confidential NHS records due to a coding error. These breaches are a problem not only the company/organization the caused the leak but also for the subjects of the data leak. This information can be used to exploit people and can cause harassment and harm. The company/organization also opens itself to negative feedback and potentially the loss of business and could also be subject to large fines.
