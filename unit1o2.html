        <h3><b>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed
               In making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello </b></h3> 
               <div class="uno1o2"> Visual Studio Code is not just a software, but it is a complete set of compilers, editors, debuggers, and everything necessary for the development of any project...however Visual Studio Code’s handles the displaying of code better and it’s ability to help with suggestions and shortcuts for creating code speeds up coding and reduces typing errors.
               <br>
               About Trello as i went more on deep on the previous Unit ,is a fantastic tool for planning and monitoring a projects progress, especially useful during teamwork.

        <h3><b>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code,  Trello</b></h3>
               <div class="uno1o2">To create my website i mainly used Visual Studio Code an excellent tool to complete the code ...the way Studio Code presents the pages and parts of the project greatly helped speed up writing the code and seeing where issues were.
               A clear strenght of VSC is its ability to auto complete suggestions for code was a great help. In the future i think i'll continue to use this tool and might i'll switch to the full version.
               <br>
               I also used Photoshop to edit which is been really usefull fot suitable for fix images used for the site, however in the future I would like to learn more about Adobe Illustrator and InDesign and go more on deep with Photoshop.
               <br>
               A weakness might be that the applications are generally made by American companies and the spelling default to US English. If the user is not aware of this and does not set this to UK English their auto-correction of spelling will be adding words that are incorrect. Similarly, a cloud based word processor is good because it can be accessed anywhere, but a weakness is that it does not have all of the formatting tools of a desktop based version and some of the formatting added by a desktop application are lost when uploaded to the cloud based system.</div>

        <h3><b>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project
               Are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</b></h3> 
               <div class="uno1o2">I am satisfied with my first website but without  doubt I know I could do better and optimize it going more on deeply with <b>CSS</b>. 
                Whilst I am happy with my final site i believe the design language is well readable and the website is easy to use, however in future i would also like to add some animation to the site to allow for a more interactive experience.

        <h3><b> Describe further improvements you can make to your project </b></h3>
               <div class="uno1o2">
                Everything can be improved that's why on the future i would definitely make it better adding animations such as having each questions opacity change as you scroll through the website or having the question pop in as you navigate down the site. I also think about accessibility features for those with disabilities, such as reviewing screen reader functionality and potentially alternative colour schemes for those with colour blindness.

        <h3><b>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</b></h3>
    <div class="uno1o2">
        Initially the layout of the page and things like background weren't beautiful to see so i had to change a few....about the rest i think i could improve some of the pages using CSS and maybe a bit more information on the  "About me" section...(things like work experience could be added).
