        <h3><b>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed
               In making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello </b></h3> 
               <div class="uno1o2"> Visual Studio Code is not just a software, but it is a complete set of compilers, editors, debuggers, and everything necessary for the development of any project...however Visual Studio Code’s handles the displaying of code better and it’s ability to help with suggestions and shortcuts for creating code speeds up coding and reduces typing errors.
               <br>
               About Trello as i went more on deep on the previous Unit ,is a fantastic tool for planning and monitoring a projects progress, especially useful during teamwork.

               <h3><b>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project
               Are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</b></h3> 
               <div class="uno1o2">I am satisfied with my first website but without  doubt I know I could do better and optimize it going more on deeply with <b>CSS</b>.

               to your project </b></h3>
               <div class="uno1o2">
                Everything can be improved that's why on the future i would definitely make it better exploiting various design skills.<br>I would also like to add animations to create it more interactive.

    <h3><b>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</b></h3>
    <div class="uno1o2">
        Initially the layout of the page and things like background weren't beautiful to see so i had to change a few....about the rest i think i could improve some of the pages using CSS and maybe a bit more information on the  "About me" section...(things like work experience could be added).
